## About The Project

A few years ago a discord bot that I was using was going to shut down as a result of some major changes to discord.py. As a result, I decided to create my own bot that closely mimicked the behavior for people who wanted to keep using it.

In order to make it easier to add new features the source for the bot remains open source and open to contributions.

## Built With

This project was built with the help of several open source projects:

- [Necord](https://necord.org/)
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- [DiscordJS](https://discordjs.dev/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```

2. Install the dependancies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file

   ```conf
   DATABASE_URL="file:../config/db.sqlite"
   TOKEN="<DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN>"
   ```

## Usage

In order to develop with the bot run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the bot and reload it when you make any changes.

For command usage see the website linked above.

## Roadmap
