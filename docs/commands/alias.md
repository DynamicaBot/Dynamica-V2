# alias

The alias command allows you to shorten the name of a game in the channel's title. This can be helpful for shortening the names of some games or, if your group has another name they refer to a game by.

The `/alias` command adds or updates an alias. So if you were playing "F1 2021" `/alias "F1 2021" "F1"` every time the channel name updates instead of `F1 2021` `F1` would appear.

:::info Options

- **activity** The name of the activity that you want to add an alias for. (Autosuggested based on the games currently being playing in the channel you're in)
- **alias** What alias you want to replace it with.
