# Introduction to Commands

Each command in this list is available as a slash command with new commands being added regularly.

Commands that modify channels in any way like `name` or `create` need the person who is executing them to have the `Dynamica Manager` role which the bot creates on startup.

## Technical Terms

During the command docs there are a few technical terms that are used. Here are the primary ones:

- **Primary Channel** - This refers to the channel that is created by the `create` command and triggers the creation of a new `Secondary` channel.
- **Secondary Channel** - This is the channel that's created by someone joining a `Primary` channel.
