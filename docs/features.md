# Features

In my efforts to make the bot easy to use for everyone new commands and features are being added regularly. Here are some of the main ones:

- **Private Channels** Using [`/lock`](./commands/lock.md) you can make a secondary channel private with only select people being allowed to join it.
- **Dynamic Channel Name** Using [`/template`](./commands/template.md) and [`/general`](./commands/general.md) you can set a template to use in the channel name that will change depending on what game is being played by the people in the channel.
- **Utility Commands** The bot also features a few utility commands to make quick changes to the channels that you are in like [`/bitrate`](./commands/bitrate.md) and [`/limit`](./commands/limit.md).
