# Getting Started

## Invite

Invite Dynamica to your server with this [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=916643283118198804&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

The bot requires a few different permissions (mainly to shuffle and create channels) but also to register slash commands!

## Create a channel

Once all that's sorted you'll probably want to create a channel. For that all you need to do is run the `/create` command. This will create a channel which your users can join to dynamically create new secondary channels.

:::tip About Secondary Channels
As soon as everyone has left a secondary channel it is deleted along with any changes you made to it.

## Congratulations

That's it! The bot is now ready to use for anyone in the server.
